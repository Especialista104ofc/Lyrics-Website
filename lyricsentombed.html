            From the day
            You arrived
            I've remained by your side
            In chains, entombed
            Placed inside
            Safe and sound
            Shapes and colors are all I see
            On the day
            You arrived
            I became your device
            To name and soothe
            Placed inside
            Safe and sound
            Shapes and colors are all I see
            Shades of colors are all I feel
            From the day you arrived
            I have stayed by your side
            Placed inside
            Safe and sound
            Shades of colors are all I see
            Shapes of colors are all I feel
            Placed inside
            Safe and sound
            Shades of colors are all I see
            Safe inside
